I have always wanted to have a career that challenges me and allows me continuous growth of my knowledge base. Man oh man, did I get just that! 

It has been a bumpy couple of weeks, between never being able to leave the house and feeling like I'm not getting any closer towards understanding the curriculum. But then there's this moment, after all of that time tapping on the keys and trying to figure out if that line should have brackets or parentheses- something just clicks! And all of a sudden you can't see how you didn't see it before! 

I think it's that moment that I crave. The moment of conquest over a good challenge! The moments that come after as you share your trials and triumphs with your peers. 

I chose data science because I knew in my heart that I would finally find a place to be among people that make me feel more like the version of myself that I work towards everyday. 

I would love to intertwine my future data science knowledge with my passion for food by working towards sustainable farming and food production. I haven't quite fleshed that one out yet, but I'm also trying this new thing where I don't try to control every aspect of my life! I'm just living a little, taking in the moment, and analyzing data!
